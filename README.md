* About this game:
+ Game's name: MineSweeper.
+ Game's Genre: 2D, Logic.
+ Game's Rule: 

This is a popular puzzle game that challenges players to uncover a grid of cells while avoiding hidden mines. The rules are straightforward yet require strategic thinking and careful decision-making. The game is played on a rectangular grid, where each cell can either be empty or contain a mine. The objective is to uncover all the empty cells without detonating any mines. Players can reveal a cell by clicking on it, and if it contains a mine, the game ends. However, if a cell is empty, it will display a number indicating the count of adjacent cells containing mines. By utilizing this information, players can deduce the location of mines and safely uncover more cells. If a player is unsure about a cell containing a mine, they can place a flag to mark it and prevent accidental clicks. The game is won when all empty cells are revealed and all mines are flagged. Minesweeper requires a combination of logical reasoning, probability assessment, and risk management to successfully navigate the grid and emerge victorious.

We have also implemented an undo function using Stack! Everytime you clicked somewhere, the state of the game is saved. Therefore everytime you click on the undo button on the menu, it will revert back to the previous game state. How cool is that!!!

P/S: The undo function does not take into account the case where you click on an 0 cell, it does allow you to revert the whole area you just open and you have to revert cell by cell. T.T

* How to play the game, you asked?

You just have to download this whole projecct into you driver (you don't have to download the report file though). Open this project with your IDE, looking for the main method in the 'GFrame' class and there we go. Enjoy your game!
